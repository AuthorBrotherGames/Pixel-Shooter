# Pixel-Shooter
Simple and easy game to play while waiting for meetings, waiting for downloads to complete, or just to have a retro throwback.  In this arcade-style game, the aim is to be the last ship standing by dodging your opponent's blaster fire, and landing your own. Play with a friend or against the game's AI.
